# java-se-students-db-application
My mini-project for adding and listing students. The program has a client part with a Swing desktop application, a server part for executing requests from the client part.
The application is multithreaded, it is possible to connect more than one client to the server at the same time.
Student data is stored in a MySQL database (connecting the MySQL library).
